### Project Name: 
**DebtRepaymentSimulator**

### Example Output

The following is an example of the output generated by the DebtRepaymentSimulator. This example assumes a scenario where the total debt is distributed among seven debtors (`o1` to `o7`), and the payment process runs for six months.

```
Month   Debtor  Pay     Payment Remaining Debt
1       o1      1.00    4.83    0.00
1       o2      2.00    3.83    0.00
1       o3      1.83    1.83    1.17
1       o4      0.00    0.00    4.00
1       o5      0.00    0.00    10.00
1       o6      0.00    0.00    2.00
1       o7      0.00    0.00    7.00
----------------------------------------
2       o3      1.17    4.83    0.00
2       o4      3.67    3.67    0.33
2       o5      0.00    0.00    10.00
2       o6      0.00    0.00    2.00
2       o7      0.00    0.00    7.00
----------------------------------------
3       o4      0.33    4.83    0.00
3       o5      4.50    4.50    5.50
3       o6      0.00    0.00    2.00
3       o7      0.00    0.00    7.00
----------------------------------------
4       o5      4.83    4.83    0.67
4       o6      0.00    0.00    2.00
4       o7      0.00    0.00    7.00
----------------------------------------
5       o5      0.67    4.83    0.00
5       o6      2.00    4.17    0.00
5       o7      2.17    2.17    4.83
----------------------------------------
6       o7      4.83    4.83    0.00
----------------------------------------
```

This output demonstrates the monthly distribution of payments among the debtors, along with the remaining debt for each after each month's payment. Note that the payment amount is distributed as evenly as possible among the debtors until the total debt is cleared.

# DebtRepaymentSimulator

## Introduction
The DebtRepaymentSimulator is a Python-based tool designed to simulate the repayment process of a specified total debt, distributed among multiple debtors over a six-month period. It provides a clear monthly breakdown of individual payments and remaining debts for each debtor.

## Features
- Calculation of total debt from a list of debtors.
- Even distribution of total debt across a six-month period.
- Monthly breakdown of payments per debtor.
- Tracking of remaining debt for each debtor.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Virtual environment (recommended for dependency management)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tanakon8529/DebtRepaymentSimulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd DebtRepaymentSimulator
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install required dependencies (if any):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```
python debt_repayment_simulator.py
```
